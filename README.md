<h4>Papersome is a self-hosted application for creating ePub newspapers or magazines from RSS/Atom feeds.</h4>

You can add feeds as sources, bundle them into collections, and read them in a newspaper or magazine-style layout.
Collections can be scheduled so new ePub publications are generated automatically. Publications can also be
synchronized to Kobo devices via Booklore.
